										<p><img height="208" width="269" src="gillian.jpg" align="right">The day kicks off with our saying goodbye to a team member again, this time Gillian. She's been in Egypt a month now, working in Cairo before coming here. She's worked here a number of years now, and has seen the pottery work through to its conclusion. The place doesn't seem the same without her. At the tomb, another old friend has gone--we surrendered the tent after Gillian left.</p>
										<p>You'll notice in this photo our latest arrival, Evan, towering above the rest of us. Evan works in the Egyptian department at the British Museum as a Museum Assistant, and he's come out here to help organise closing up the tomb and packing the objects for storage.</p>
										<p>Evan trains hard in the UK and plays basketball for the Reading Rockets. To keep him fit, Helen immediately organises a workout for him, running up and down the ladder into the pottery shaft to remove things destined for storage elsewhere. Later on I get him to prepare some cartonnage assemblages for Tony to photograph. You can see how dirty he got from moving things around in the left-hand photo below. At the right you see the pottery storage area after Helen finished her reorganisation of it by location and type.</p>

										<p>This turned out to be a long day. While Evan continued to put cartonnages together in preparation for photographing, Tony started on the decorated textiles. We mentioned in an earlier diary that we had an excellent and unusual selection of such things used as mummy wrappings, and this is why we brought April out to work on them. Julie has finished conserving them, and April has almost finished studying, and so it was a good time to photograph them.</p>

We need to discuss the question of registering objects with the General Director, and so we arrange to go to the Inspectorate to see him, as he has been very tied up with the possible visit of President Mubarak which has still not happened!</p>
										<p>At the Inspectorate, it seems that all foreign missions are arriving at once. In the past week, French, Italian, Swiss, Polish and American missions have all arrived. Such a change from when we were the first ones here. All goes very well, and we are to start work on the register book tomorrow. We also get the keys to the other tombs we have requested permission to visit for study purposes. In fact Abdul-Rahman wants that we go off and do the first ones today, but first we are visited by the Director, Mohamed el-Bialey, who wishes to look over the finds. We have a very pleasant visit from him, and he is extremely complimentary about what we have been doing.</p>
										<p>Today Abdul-Rahman suggests that we begin our work on the other tombs which we have asked to look at for comparative purposes. These tombs tend to be unpublished ones, and we want to check certain details for the purposes of the publication of TT99. Today we look at TT122 and TT64, the tombs of Amenhotep and Heqaneheh. Here you see us waiting while the first tomb is opened.</p>

In the end we agree, and Abdul-Rahman and I prepare to start writing in the Register Book.</p>

										<h3>Thursday 25 October</h3>
										<p>Today is going to be hard work for me and Abdul-Rahman. We have to register as many of the objects as we can. This means that I write the English entries for the book, and then he writes the same in Arabic. We have to look at the objects, and there are the expected difficulties of translation. It goes slowly. The last thing for each object is that I stick a photograph in the book, primarily for identification purposes. It's a time-consuming job.</p>
										<p>At the same time, Evan is organising the packing of the objects into trays at the back of the tomb. He has covered the base of the trays with a foam covering, and is locating the objects in the trays using small foam blocks which he holds in place with small wooden cocktail sticks.

Here is one, with Julie holding up the scale while Helen takes the picture.

										<p>I said that it would be a long day. Abdul-Rahman and I get to object number 75 at about 16:15 and call it a day. Julie has also been working late on the paintings. We are all very tired, but it has been worthwhile, as it means it brings getting to the magazine to deposit the material is closer.</p>
