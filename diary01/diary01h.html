										<h3>Friday 26 October</h3>
										<p>I have to confess that I was so tired after the marathon the previous day that I did not venture beyond the hotel, but rather took time to rest, and also to catch up on some needed work, like updating our databases of the objects and producing lists of the objects we would be registering. I also updated the dig diary and worked on some videos. Helen did some drawing but she was also very tired and stayed in. Julie spent much of the day sorting out some of her conservation equipment and supplies prior to our packing up. But Evan and April kept up the spirit of adventure and went to Deir el-Bahari and the Valley of the Kings in the morning and to Karnak in the afternoon. In the evening we were invited to a very pleasant dinner at Mohamed el-Bialey's house in the Western Valley of the Kings. There it is very very silent, and there was even a short power cut during which we could see the beauty of the place in the moonlight.</p>

										<p>Abdul-Rahman and I start by finishing off the register book. When this is done, he goes off down to the Inspectorate to see about arrangements for getting them to the magazine as soon as possible. Here you see the crate we are using temporarily to store them, and Julie completing conservation on the ivory adzes.</p>

There are a number of stone blocks still on the floors of the tomb which have to be put down a shaft before we finish. Shaft F is the chosen target, and we lower them down, with Helen at the top noting the numbers, me at the bottom arranging them, and Evan doing the bulk of the work lowering them down.</p>

We choose bags from different but representative contexts. Down Shaft A we also revisit the mummy of the priest Wedjahor, who was buried in the tomb in about 705 BC.
										</p>
										<p>In the middle of the morning Abdul-Rahman arrives back with the news that we might not get in the magazine today, as another one has to be opened first. We don't mind so long as we are sure of getting in tomorrow, as we're all off on Monday. We have a shaft cover which needs fixing, so Abdul-Rahman supervises the repairs in the courtyard.</p>

Evan and I finalise the arrangement of the objects which we expect to take to the magazine today, and Helen is entering location codes for these objects into our database. While we wait for the call to the magazine, she and Evan also take more photos of wall fragments for Julie.</p>
										<p>At just after 10 am the call comes. We are to get the finds down to the area of the tomb of Ramose to go to the magazine. This is no small task, as we have four heavy wooden boxes of finds, and the way down is very steep. Eventually a local donkey cart is pressed into service, with everyone acting as brakes to help the poor animal get down the hill.</p>

One bit of foam was blown off and retrieved by the chief guard who was following on his motorbike. At the Carter Magazine, the boxes are unloaded and then work starts on the registered objects. Each one and its description written in the book has to be checked by a committee of four senior inspectors; poor Abdul-Rahman gets a hard time where they disagree with the exact nature of what he has written. As this goes on, Evan places each object in its allotted place in the tray system. Once we have placed this year's material in the trays, we open a box from 1994 and place its contents in the better storage of the new cupboard. Then we rapidly empty the three boxes of study finds into the other part of the cupboard. Everyone (except us, as Evan did out estimates very carefully) is surprised when it all fits. Here you can see pictures of both sides of the cupboard; you will note that we have had it painted bright red so we can identify it easily:</p>

										<p>Getting the magazine done is a major achievement and we all really feel we are nearly there now. But there is still more to do in the tomb. We still have three large boxes of coffin fragments in the tomb chapel, and we have agreed to lower these down Shaft E at the back of the tomb before we finish. Evan suggests a system of ropes, and we do this with the assistance of one of our best guards and also the man who painted the cupboard who happened to come along at this time to collect his money! Note how many Egyptians take of their galabeyas when doing hard physical work.</p>

The final closing up of the tomb is left to me and Helen, although a lot of the work had been done the day before. This is all about packing up equipment and tidying the chapel--all the antiquities have been dealt with the day before of course.</p>

This has a number of interesting scenes and some unusual arrangements; it's a carved tomb and the photos I took don't really do it justice. Here's a close-up of a rather nice pig. The other tomb was the adjacent TT124, but although we found the entrance, it appears either to have been destroyed or simply become filled with debris, so we don't do anything.</p>
