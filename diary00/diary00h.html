										<p>The day got off to a dramatic start, as mother dog bit one of the guards who must have frightened her a bit. It is interesting to note how much more aggressive dogs are to people wearing <i>galabiyas</i> than to those wearing trousers. This is presumably because they tend to associate trousers with foreigners who feed them and perhaps pet them, while the locals tend to throw things at the dogs!</p>
										<p>Bridget is due to leave tomorrow, and thus has to get on with mounting the fragments she has conserved, so that they can be safely stored and photographed. There is going to be no time to try and arrange them in their proper places. It is more important to get the stuff into a better condition.</p>

										<p>Pamela will also be leaving soon, and thus she is sorting out many of the things which need to be done. Among these is photographing the vessels for her records; she is principally concentrating on those with inscriptions, since it is really good to have both the inscribed labels on the jars and the context of the jar. Our main problem is that none of us read hieratic...

										<p>Everything is continuing much as yesterday. John has moved on to looking at the other remaining material, mostly pieces of wood from the burial chamber of Senneferi, which are probably from coffins. He agrees with that initial diagnosis, and comments how little is left--it really does seem that the burial was smashed up a lot, if we look at how broken the pottery is and how damaged the shroud and papyri are. However, the fact that we are learning so much from this material shows what can be achieved with careful work.

										<p>Today we were offered the chance to visit the first of the tombs on our study list this year. This was the tomb of Amenemhat (TT82), which is in the hill just above us. This tomb was published by Gardiner and Davies in 1914, but there are a number of things we wanted to check in it.
										</p>
										<p>The tomb is one of the few in the necropolis to have a decorated burial chamber, which was plastered and inscribed with Book of the Dead texts; there is also a small decorated niche there.</p>

										<p>The tomb chapel itself is quite well-preserved, with some very colourful paintings, as you see below. Note the stela on the left; in addition to bearing a date of year 28 of Thutmose III (which makes Amenemhat more or less a contemporary of Senneferi), you can see figures from an earlier composition visible through the paint of the stela. This is one of the most interesting examples of repainting I have ever seen in Thebes.</p>
