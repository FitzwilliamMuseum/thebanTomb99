										<h3>Saturday 7 October</h3>
										<p>A new week starts. Progress on all fronts today. Perhaps the most interesting is that on the coffins. John has been putting together fragments all morning, and he has been able to come up with some initial thoughts on the names and genealogies of the owners of the cartonnage mummy cases he has been working on. We seem to have the case of Djedhoriufankh (right below), whose father was Nespaperennub although we do not seem to have his burial; there is certainly one daughter of Djedhoriufankh called Tabaken...; and perhaps another daughter ending ...namun (left below). There is also the case of a woman called Tayuheret. Djedhoriufankh would seem on stylistic grounds to date to the early 22nd dynasty. So we are beginning to fill in the history of the tomb in the early Third Intermediate Period -- this all shows how important the coffins are.</p>

										<p>Bridget has been conserving some unusual fragments of papyrus, which seem to have writing in white ink. This is rather unusual, and she does not recall seeing this on a Book of the Dead in the British Museum, although there is white writing on the papyrus of Henutmehyt, which is on long-term loan from Reading. We'll have to do some work on this one. Click <a href="../movies/papyrus/papyrus.html">here</a> for a short movie of Bridget working on her papyri (350k in size).</p><p align="center"><img height="270" width="219" src="faience.jpg">

										  <p>Helen has been drawing a faience vessel with elaborate designs on the outside. We are not exactly sure of the date of this, nor of the shape, as parallels tend to be from the Tuna el-Gebel area and are more like chalices. There is no doubt that they date to the Third Intermediate Period, however. Click <a href="../movies/odraw/odraw.html">here</a> for a short movie of Helen drawing an object (268k in size).</p>

										<p>More developments are taking place at the back of the tomb, where John is continuing to join together masses of cartonnage fragments. He has already revised the genealogy I gave above, noting that the father of Djedhoriufankh was in fact Djedkhonsuiufankh and that Nespaperennub was his grandfather.
										</p>
										<p>Today I more or less finish regrouping and counting the shabtis. Here you can see an almost complete group of overseer shabtis of <a href="../finds/shabtis.html">Neshathor</a>.</p>

										<p>One of the objects Helen was to draw today was the strange thing at left. Given that there are various objects associated with he Opening of the Mouth ritual in the burial of Senneferi (see <a href="../diary99/diary99j.html">last year's diary</a>), we suspected that it might be a 'ritual object'; today John pointed out that it was almost certainly a wooden model censer on which a small cup for burning incense would have been placed.</p>

										<p>Pottery drawing and gluing is going on apace inside the tomb, while outside the sorting of sherds continued. Today Pamela took a first look at the material from the bottom of the other courtyard shaft (Shaft H); here you see her weighing some of it. First indications are that the pottery at the bottom is 18th dynasty but later than that of Senneferi. If this is borne out by further work, it would support my hunch that this could be a burial place for members of Senneferi's family.
										</p>
										<p><b>Dog diary</b>: fairly quiet, although one of the puppies greets Pamela by gnawing away at the laces on her shoes. Mother dog spends much of the time asleep further down the hill near Rekhmire; is she finding the children a lot of work?</p>

										<p>&nbsp;Today we start with the Dog diary. As we arrive, mother dog rushes up for food, while the puppies play around chewing our shoelaces and so on.
										</p>
										<p>Most of the human activity is inside the tomb. Helen draws amulets, while Bridget has now moved to mounting the fragments, as she will be leaving on Wednesday afternoon, and does not want a last minute rush at this. Pottery work varies between drawing and doing some final sorts of the Senneferi material; from now on, most of the work will be gluing and drawing.</p>
