										<p>Today is going to be our last day on which we actually work on the tomb material. I am already starting packing away the objects, as that is the most important thing to sort out in the tomb. Helen continues drawing her objects, and gets them finished in the course of the morning. Today is Gillian's last day, and she also finishes off her drawings. We are fortunate to get a visit from Dr Briant Bohleke of Chicago House, who last year made a preliminary transcriptions of the jar labels on the Senneferi vessels. As more sherds have been joined this year, he has a lot more material on which to work, and can improve on lots of last year's ideas. One particularly important find was a date of year 38 <img src="date.gif" alt="year 38 glyphs" width="48" height="25" align="absmiddle"> on a pilgrim flask. There can be no doubt that this relates to Thutmose III, and shows that the burial cannot have taken place before that date, somewhere about 1450 BC.</p>

										<p>Today I also did the last of our comparative tombs, TT226; the name of the owner is not known, but it could be Heqareshu. This tomb was already destroyed when it was copied by Davies, but I wanted to get an idea of the state of the monument for an article I am writing about it. The tomb is interesting in that it is clear that parts of it were already collapsing when it was built, as certain areas (in the close-up photo) were built from brick walls rather than the solid rock.</p>

										<p>In the afternoon we had a rest before the inevitable packing. Ray Johnson had invited us for the evening to Chicago House--this was incredibly kind of him, and it made a wonderful end to the season for us all. We bade farewell to Amanda when we headed off for the airport and the plane to Cairo. She is going to Cairo by train--she's also the first person other than myself and Helen to have been with us for the whole of a season, and it's been great fun to have her along (she did a lot of work too!!).</p>

We had to say cheerio to friends at the Cairo Museum who had helped us so much at the beginning of the season. Then I had to see again Ahmed Mostafa, whom I sponsored on a visit to Britain last year. He took us for lunch on a boat moored on the Nile. After that we went back and slept.</p>
