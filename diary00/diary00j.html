										<p>And now to our trip. The aim was to look at some tombs in Dra Abul Naga, the northern part of the cemetery, and the most heavily occupied area, and (frankly) one of the dirtiest and most problematic.
										</p>
										<p>We wanted to start by looking for the tomb of Tetiky (TT15), which is one of the earliest New Kingdom tombs in Thebes, dating perhaps to the beginning of the 18th dynasty. The tomb was found by Lord Carnarvon in 1907-8, and was the subject of an article by Norman de Garis Davies, but has not been seen for a number of years.</p>
										<p>We went with the General Director, Mohamed el-Bialey, to try and find it. After a lot of asking around among the older inhabitants, we still did not find it, but isolated an area where there is said to be a tomb buried under a load of rubble/rubbish. It would be an enormous job to dig it out; here's a mini-panorama, with the possible location in the centre:</p>

										<p>Our next target was another early 18th dynasty tomb, that of Hery (TT12), roughly in the middle of the area (see a <a href="../movies/dra00.html">VR panorama</a>, size 176k). This is entered via a breakthrough from TT11, so we were able to visit that as well. This tomb is full of rubble still, and probably has not been visited for a long time. There are at least two further tombs which can be accessed through it, so we went climbing around the back of it. Below is a picture of one of the relief scenes, and also of Mohamed, Helen and me climbing around on the rubble. The graffito over the wall scene is from the Ptolemaic period, when the tomb was used for storing Ibis mummies.</p>

										<p>In the tomb, Tony begins to make photos of some of the walls of the tomb, but when the light gets better he is back outside finishing the pots. We've had to prioritise things, and we decided that he should do those things which a) are most urgent (e.g. the pots) and b) which he can do better than the rest of us (the tomb paintings, as he has such good equipment for it).</p>

										<p>We also get to see our other locked tomb in the necropolis today, that of Menkheperresoneb (TT86), in the hill just above us. This tomb is approximately contemporary to Senneferi; it was never finished, and Menkheperresoneb had another tomb down in the Khokha area (TT112). It is a nice tomb, with some wonderful representations of foreigners. Again, one does not realise from the publication quite what it was like. The following pictures show craftsmen at work, and some of the foreigners. A nice tomb!</p>
